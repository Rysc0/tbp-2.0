when installing pgAdmin you need to set postgres user password to be able to connect to the local db
to do so login to the psql with

sudo -u postgres psql

then do this:
	\password

enter new password

go back to pgAdmin and connect with that password




BACKUP

backup can be made from pgAdmin
	right click on database -> BACKUP

the same thing can be made manually with pg_dump
	pg_dump -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -W -d postgres -f /home/rysco/tbp/db/dump.sql

this can be run in bash, -W asks for postgres user password
